"""
Convenience methods for calculating a number of similarity error
measures between one or more reference and hypothesis sentences.
These measures are commonly used to measure the performance of
an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system.

The following measures are implemented:

- Word Error Rate (WER), which is where this library got its name from. This
  has long been (and arguably still is) the de facto standard for computing
  ASR performance.
- Match Error Rate (MER)
- Word Information Lost (WIL)
- Word Information Preserved (WIP)
- Character Error Rate (CER)

Note that these functions merely call
[jiwer.process_words][process.process_words] and
[jiwer.process_characters][process.process_characters].
It is more efficient to call `process_words` or `process_characters` and access the
results from the
[jiwer.WordOutput][process.WordOutput] and
[jiwer.CharacterOutput][process.CharacterOutput]
classes.
